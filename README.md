# Gas-Detector
Hello guys this is my first repository created.

I know that there is already gas sensors in this world today. But I wanted to make a gas sensor that is very useful to us today. I wanted to make a gas sensor that can be fitted in homes, factories and especially for gas manufacturing companies. In the college there was fiew sensors available but the sensor that I wanted was not available in our college so I decided to order on myself. The gas sensor that I want to make is to work with Arduino and to figure out a code that can work suitably for the sensor. What my sensor is different to others is that when a gas is detected it will send an alert email to the company holder.
